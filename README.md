Overview:
This notebook demonstrates the development of a simple Flask-based chatbot. The chatbot is implemented using Python and designed to handle basic interactions, providing a foundation for more complex natural language processing (NLP) applications. The notebook includes both the backend logic for the chatbot and a simple Flask web interface.

Key Features:

1. Flask Framework:

The notebook includes a lightweight web application using Flask, which serves as the interface for the chatbot.
It demonstrates how to set up routes and handle HTTP requests.

2. Chatbot Logic:

Implements basic chatbot logic, allowing the bot to respond to predefined inputs.
The chatbot is set up to provide responses based on pattern matching and simple rule-based techniques.

3. Integration:

Shows how to integrate Flask with a backend chatbot, enabling interaction between the user (frontend) and the chatbot's logic (backend).
Demonstrates local server setup for testing chatbot functionality.

4. Future Scope:

This foundational demo can be extended to incorporate more advanced NLP features such as language understanding, sentiment analysis, and the use of machine learning models to enhance responses.
Potential for integration with databases or external APIs to increase the chatbot's knowledge base.

Dependencies:
Flask: For creating the web interface.
Python 3.x: The core logic of the chatbot is written in Python.
Jinja2: For templating within the Flask web application.

Usage:
Simply run the notebook cells to launch the chatbot locally.
Once running, navigate to the provided local address in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

Potential Use Cases:
Building interactive web-based applications with basic AI functionalities.
Exploring Flask-based web applications with a focus on interactivity.
Extending the chatbot to support customer service, FAQ handling, or simple conversational agents.
